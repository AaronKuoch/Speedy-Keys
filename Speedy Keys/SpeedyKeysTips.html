  Addtional Tips
</h3>

<li> Keep your keyboard home row height as close to elbow level as possible.
<li> Centre the spacebar with your body.
<li> Do not angle or bend your wrists. While typing keep your wrists elevated and as straight as possible.
<li> Avoid hunt-and-peck typing
    as it causes strain on the neck from having to look down at the keyboard often.
<li> Don't use more force than needed to press the keys.
<li> When you are not typing make sure to rest your arms and hands. However, never rest your arms, hands or wrist on a sharp edge.
<li> Take a break from typing every 20 to 30 minutes.

</ul>
